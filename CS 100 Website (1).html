              <li><h3>Early Life</h3></li>
                    <p>
                        I was born, in Cincinatti Ohio, on January 7th 1997. When I was two years old, my parents and I moved back to their home town of louisville Kentucky.
                        My parents bought a house next door to their longtime friends, the Schaefers. The Schaefers had a son named Andrew born just 8 days before me.
                        Andrew and I eventually became best and even attened grade school and high school togeher. As a young kid I was always intested in animal, 
                        cowboys, art, and technology. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I attened SMM from Kindergarden through eigth-grade. While I was a student their I played football, basketball, soccer, baseball, tennis, and Lacrosse.
                        I was lucky enough to when the city title in both basketball and baseball, along with two footabll toybowls and a runner-up. While in grade school sports
                        and art where the two activities I spent most of time doing. I was not an overly dedicated student, but I did enjoy math and science.

                    <p>
                        Like my dad I chose to attened Saint Xavier HighSchool. While at Saint X sports and art where still the main focuses in my life. I played year round
                        lacrosse. I was a defensive long pole, which means I played at the midfielder position, defense only, with a six foot stick instead of a three foot
                        stick. <strong>We won three state title while I was there</strong>, and they are some of my foundest memories. I also spent a lot of time in the art wing of the school
                        where I sampled in countless mediums including digital design. I enjoyed art so much I considered persuing it as a craeer and attending a design
                        school in Georgia. Ultimatly I decided to attend The University of Kentucky. While in highSchool I was fortunate enough to meet a wonderful girl named
                        Taylor. We started dating at the end of sophmoore year. We are still dating to this day and plan on getting married soon. I graduated from highSchool 
                        in 2015.

                    <P>
                       <i>Although I grew up a Louisville fan, I decided to attend the University of Kentucky. Where I joined a fratunity and decided to pursure a degree 
                        in finance. After my first dreadful economics class and without telling any of my family and friends I switched my major to animal Science. I had 
                        decided my goal was to become a farmer and raise beef cattle. I worked positions in every area of the field. I worked at a research slaughter house,
                        I worked for a cattle broker, at a stockyard, but I spent most of my time on a 3000 acre cattle farm outside of Lexington. I was a farm hand at 
                        Mount Zion Farms for three years, where I tended to the 500 head of cattle, tobacco, corn, soy bean, and hay. Helping raise cattle was the most   
                        expeirence I have ever had. <em>I still hope to one day to raise some cattle of my own. </em></i>

                        After graduating from UK my father and I purchased a cabin rental business. I moved to Slade Kentucky, a town with the population of less that 
                        fifty residents. I was resposible for managing properties for other individuals and tending to guest during their stays. Soon I will be leaving
                        the Red River Gorge and becoming a <b>fulltime student pursing a second degree in software engineering.</b>
